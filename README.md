# Acoustic Source Localization
A Python-based visual simulation demonstrating acoustic source localization using an array of microphones. The simulation shows how sound waves propagate from a source and reach multiple microphones, enabling triangulation of the sound source position.
## Features
- Real-time visualization of sound wave propagation
- Radial array of 5 microphones arranged in a circular pattern
- Visual triangulation process showing how source location is determined
## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/acoustic-source-localization.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
